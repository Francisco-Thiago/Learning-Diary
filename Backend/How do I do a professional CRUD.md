# How do I do a professional CRUD

# Day 01: Planning

The main topics I need to learn are:

### MUST LEARN
- Unitary tests.
- Security.
- SQL and PQSQL.
- Spring Annotations.
- Docker

### WOULD BE GOOD
- Code pattern.
- Clean code.
- Git.

I don't know exactly which aspects of a CRUD make them "professional", so the list may change at some point. 

Let's start with a simple project just to practice PQSQL and unitary tests easy.

- FIRST PROJECT: Conference Room Reservation System
```
{
    User (id, name, email, password, created_at, updated_at, reservations_fk, role),
    UserGroup: (id, name, users, permissions)
    ConferenceRoom (id, name, capacity, location, equipment, reservations_fk),
    Reservation: (id, start_date, end_date, user_id, conference_room_id, description),
    Equipment: (id, name, available_quantity, total_quantity)
}
```

The system is simple, each part of the system will have a permission. The admin generated by default can set which users can do what they do. The users can see/do just what their permissions allow. The project will be made in pt-BR and en-US, so I need to learn about internacionalization.

Technologies: Spring Boot 3, java 17, PQSQL (can be another).

# Day 02: Start
- [x] Create a base project

# Day 03: Fixing deficits in SQL 1/2
- [x] Learn SQL theory

After studying I fixed the strange system database. User group could be just a role, but I left it like that (permission_activity by group) because I never created a system that way. The logical model can be improved. I don't know how to use view or advanced instructions yet, I will study these topics tomorrow.

# Day 04: Fixing deficits in SQL 2/2
- [X] Learn advanced instructions in SQL and refactor if necessary
- [X] Add configuration, flyway and tables.
- [ ] Add entities and repositories.

For some reason flyway stopped working, I can't create entities and repositories because of this. So I'll fix it tomorrow.

# Day 05: Docs (Continue after Programming Habit).
- [ ] Search how to make a good documentation with Swagger 3.
- [ ] Add swagger and base controller with docs.
