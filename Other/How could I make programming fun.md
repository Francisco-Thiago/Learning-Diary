# How could I make programming fun?

# Day 01: Planning and doing
To create a new habit I need some strategies.


## Planning

### 1. Start small and add more minutes little by little.

For 3 days I will study programming during 5 minutes. I will add 5 minutes each 3 days until I finally reach 1h30.

### 2. Define a specific time to study.

5PM every day.

### 3. Start with something simple and with quick feedback.

Front end is the most simple thing and with quick feedback.

### 4. Join in programming groups.

For now, no. I want be focused in programming for at least 1 week before do something else. I will look for groups on Discord later.

### 5. Watch programming videos

That can be hard because I don't watch videos at all. But I will start watch one video in the morning when I had time.

### 6. Do side projects for fun, without any intention.

Start a project now would be impossible, 5 minutes isn't enough. I will consider when I reach at least 40 minutes. This project could be a game, an app or something else.

## Doing
WOW, that was nostalgic, a simple html and stylesheet. The time was short, so I made a simple card.

# Day 02: immersed
I forgot to set a time and started to develop without sense of time. The color theory was the hardest point, find a good color isn't so simple. Because the background is black, the button is strange with any other color color than black. Yellow and red are super weird, but black is neutre.

# Day 03: So short
It's awesome what front end does. I just added a menu now. Tomorrow I will increase 5 minutes.

# Day 04: Icons
I added icons and some details in the logo. I have plans to make a carousel and the script to make the side bar viable.
