# How could I make programming fun?

## Day 01: Planning and doing
To create a new habit I need some strategies.


### Planning

#### 1. Start small and add more minutes little by little.

For 3 days I will study programming during 5 minutes. I will add 5 minutes each 3 days until I finally reach 1h30.

#### 2. Define a specific time to study.

5PM every day.

#### 3. Start with something simple and with quick feedback.

Front end is the most simple thing and with quick feedback.

#### 4. Join in programming groups.

For now, no. I want be focused in programming for at least 1 week before do something else. I will look for groups on Discord later.

#### 5. Watch programming videos

That can be hard because I don't watch videos at all. But I will start watch one video in the morning when I had time.

#### 6. Do side projects for fun, without any intention.

Start a project now would be impossible, 5 minutes isn't enough. I will consider when I reach at least 40 minutes. This project could be a game, an app or something else.

### Doing
WOW, that was nostalgic, a simple html and stylesheet. The time was short, so I made a simple card.

## Day 02: immersed
I forgot to set a time and started to develop without sense of time. The color theory was the hardest point, find a good color isn't so simple. Because the background is black, the button is strange with any other color color than black. Yellow and red are super weird, but black is neutre.

## Day 03: So short
It's awesome what front end does. I just added a menu now. Tomorrow I will increase 5 minutes.

## Day 04: Icons
I added icons and some details in the logo. I have plans to make a carousel and a script to make the sidebar viable. I know it's strange, but programming already became something fun for me. I notice it when the first thing I thought was just "add something in my html". It's simple and satisfactory. Sometimes we work so hard to learn new technologies that we forgot the happiness of these simple things. I just want to make beautiful things on my screen :)

## Day 05: Comming back
After a short trip, I paused progress. I started the footer, but it's not complete yet. Tomorrow I will add items and correct the alignment. Since processing is more natural, now I'm going to speed up. I developed 20 minutes today. Every 1 day I will add 10m until I reach the 2h30 mark.

## Day 06: Losing the rhythm

I ended up losing the rhythm of my studies because of the break. I made something really simple now, I just adjusted the main content and add more cards. Tomorrow I will fill the footer.

## Day 07: Carousel

I tried to put a carousel on it.. I had one on codepen, but it needs some adaptations. I used unsplash to generate random images.

## Day 08: Stop and do it right! (1/15)

I had another travel and stopped to code again. I took time to think about it all. "What am I doing wrong?". It's easy do the things I doing but at the same time boring. I want to learn something more useful. Thinking in it I decided use pomodoro and see a course to learn interesting topics. My first goul will be learn more about java 08 and 11 in 15 days. I miss something more defined in my studies, this makes me procrastinate.

## Day 09: basic concepts (2/15)

I studied about Lambda and interfaces.
