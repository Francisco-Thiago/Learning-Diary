# How could I make programming fun?

# Day 01: Planning and doing
To create a new habit I need some strategies.


## Planning

### 1. Start small and add more minutes little by little.

For 3 days I will study programming during 5 minutes. I will add 5 minutes each 3 days until I finally reach 1h30.

### 2. Define a specific time to study.

5PM every day.

### 3. Start with something simple and with quick feedback.

Front end is the most simple thing and with quick feedback.

### 4. Join in programming groups.

For now, no. I want be focused in programming for at least 1 week before do something else. I will look for groups on Discord later.

### 5. Watch programming videos

That can be hard because I don't watch videos at all. But I will start watch one video in the morning when I had time.

### 6. Do side projects for fun, without any intention.

Start a project now would be impossible, 5 minutes isn't enough. I will consider when I reach at least 40 minutes. This project could be a game, and app or something else.

## Doing
WOW, that was nostalgic, a simple html and stylesheet. The time was short, so I made a simple card.
