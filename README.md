# Learning-Diary
Here I will describe what I learned and want to improve every day. Basically I will define a topic like "Develop a Website with XXX" and then I will put some tasks and write the proccess and improvements. My goal with this is use the [QDD (Question Drive Development)](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/learning-a-new-web-framework-with-question-driven-development) by default. Each topic will be described below followed by the file with the days spent.
